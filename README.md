# 30-Days-of-Deep-Learning
This repository contains the 30 days of deep learning challenge that I've taken up that covers different algorithms/neural networks and different frameworks and pre-trained models.
Datasets are derived from many sources, and some taken access from my friends gdrive and one completely built on my own. Frpm data preprocessing to building and futher implementing the models, getting everything covered in the model.
will have a web based application that uses my model backend at the end of the 30 days cahllenge
